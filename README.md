Shippable support
=================

This repo track customer bugs and feature requests for Shippable's CI/CD cloud service.

Instructions
------------

* Go to the issues list for this repository and create a new issue
* Use the following tags -
    * Tag bugs in existing functionality with 'bug'
    * Add 'blocking' tag for anything that is super important to fix. We will address these issues with the highest priority.
    * Features that you need but are not currently supported should be tagged with 'feature request'. Please do not tag these as bugs. 

**We will triage reported issues every week, except blocking issues, which will be addressed within 24 hours.** We will update the issue frequently with latest status, so you will be constantly aware of what is happening. 

We will update the issue with these tags as the bug goes through our process -
* 'triaged' after we have looked at the bug and decided on a course of action.
* 'planned' when the bug or feature request is accepted into a milestone.
* 'in progress' when it is actually assigned to an engineer. 
* 'deployed' when code changes are complete and deployed into production.

There might be times when we cannot address some issues, either due to technical limitations or if the scenario requested gets too specific to one customer. In these cases, we will mark the bug as -
* 'by design' if the behavior described in the bug is as designed.
* 'wont fix' if we cannot address the issue due to some reason.
In both these cases, we will provide you with an explanation of why we reached this decision.
